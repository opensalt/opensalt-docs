Introduction
============

**CASE**

CASE establishes a new, global technical standard for the exchange of machine readable, linked data versions of state and national academic standards, local learning objectives and targets, or any workplace, military, or higher education competencies representing skills, knowledge, or abilities.

**OpenSALT**

To support CASE, PCG Education (A national public sector consulting practice); ACT Inc and SchoolCity (both leading curriculum and assessment providers), partnered on the development of the open source project called OpenSALT, that provides a free, IMS-conformance certified tool that enables education organizations to manage and publish frameworks and crosswalks to other standards.

Developed as an open source project, OpenSALT provides for easy exchange of state standards data and provides for and enables alignment services to align educational content to learning standards, as well as correlate (Crosswalk) between different state standards and competency frameworks.


**Key features that distinguish OpenSALT:**

* Easily create derivative frameworks from national standards for use within States

* Create customized competency frameworks with connections to national and state frameworks as needed

* Set learning progressions within a framework

* Allow different views of a framework (For example, view the Standards of Engineering Practices in the NGSS framework separately from the DCI statements)

* Filter frameworks by keyword

* Enabled for the common alignment of resources and assessments to standards

* A Consistent digital format that can be easily integrated into ed-tech products and internal documents alike (Export to the standardized CASE Format as well as spreadsheets)

1.0  Audience
=============

This document is intended as a complete guide for using OpenSALT. This document is specially designed for all users with advanced permissions or non-specialists who may find the document useful as a  point of reference. By reading this guide, you will learn how to use OpenSALT through the elements of the graphical user interface (GUI) and explanations of some of the advanced features to provide best practices. This guide will help you to navigate and easily use OpenSALT. The functions and features described in this guide will indicate any role restrictions or limitations as to what users can access or interact with the given system function.

.. _h486792f4a12b6443784e11c1032c:

1.1 Platform Requirements
-------------------------

The user interface is designed using current web standards and supports most modern browsers, in their current supported versions, on a variety of desktop and mobile devices.

The user interface requires JavaScript to be enabled and internet access to be available (no support for an offline mode is currently available).

The user interface should support the latest versions of the following web browsers on desktop and mobile devices:

* Chrome

* Internet Explorer

* Edge

* Safari

* Firefox

.. _h787f432939517708191470483c5f43:

2.0  OpenSALT Structure and Access
===================================

OpenSALT is designed to be an open, publicly accessible, framework site that allows transparency in frameworks and crosswalks. By design users are able to traverse and view the published frameworks and content by accessing the main url for the given site. OpenSALT then utilizes a login that allows provisioned users to create, edit and otherwise interact with the frameworks for the site.

.. _h5064c4520537f221a7341492e6a4025:

2.1 OpenSALT Structure
----------------------

OpenSALT goes to the home page by default, and also has a document tree view. The Doc Tree View shows a framework and information about the framework on the right hand side, where logged in users with proper permissions can edit items, associate with other framework items, and copy other framework items into the current framework.

.. _h673d3c62a785f726a6b6333444e4b70:

2.2 OpenSALT Home Page
----------------------

The image below is an example of an OpenSALT site, OpenSALT.net hosted by PCG. When user launches opensalt.net in a browser, the user is presented with the open view of the site.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_2.png

This is a view of an OpenSALT site hosted by ACT, located at frameworks.act.org

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_3.png
   :height: 104 px
   :width: 624 px


All public, non-provisioned users are able to view the frameworks and content with each form this view. Navigating the frameworks will be further discussed in a later section of this document.

2.3 Log into OpenSALT
----------------------

For provisioned users the **Sign in** button will launch a login screen that will enable deeper system usage and open up available menus for further interaction with OpenSALT.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_4.png
   :height: 204 px
   :width: 366 px


Provisioned users can enter in their *Username* (user’s email) and *Password* then click the **Login** button to access the admin functions for OpenSALT.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_5.png
   :height: 116 px
   :width: 624 px


After logging in a provisioned user will now see the *Sign In* button replaced by “Signed in as *username*” (email) with a menu icon  and two new buttons on the main frame of the page:  **Create a new Framework** and **Import Framework**

.. _h5b52241c7178667e18023622a381f1:

2.4 Log off from OpenSALT
-------------------------

All provisioned users should log out of OpenSALT when finished with their session. To logout, click on the expansion menu next to the user name and select **Sign out**.

6.2.1 Import Frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Audience: Super Users, Super Editor, Organization Admins, Organization Editor**

OpenSALT has two methods for importing in an existing CASE-compliant framework into the site.

1) Import a CASE Compliant (JSON) file
2) Import a non-CASE compliant Spreadsheet file

.. _h3f23193f6633791f3f387f632bb3d54:

6.2.1.1 Import CASE-Compliant (JSON) File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenSALT allows users to import known CASE-compliant framework files into the system. Click on the **Import CASE file** tab in the  **Import Framework** window. Then click **Choose File.**

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_56.png
   :height: 180 px
   :width: 521 px


Navigate on your computer to the correct Case-compliant JSON file to import then  click **Open**.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_57.png
   :height: 268 px
   :width: 530 px


The filename will display in the Choose File box, then click the **Import Framework** button to import the framework.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_58.png
   :height: 171 px
   :width: 489 px


To cancel the action and not import the file, click on the **Close** button.

6.2.1.2 Import Framework from spreadsheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_spreadsheet.png
   :height: 171 px
   :width: 489 px

On the Import screen, you are able to import a spreadsheet. For the spreadsheet importer, FullStatement is the primary required field.
The spreadsheet template is here_:

.. _here: https://github.com/opensalt/opensalt/blob/develop/docs/sample%20files/spreadsheet_import_template.xlsx

Additionally, a Sample Spreadsheet is available as well_:

.. _well: https://github.com/opensalt/opensalt/blob/develop/docs/sample%20files/spreadsheet_import_sample.xlsx

To create a basic framework via the spreadsheet import template, you must populate the FullStatement and SmartLevel in the CF Item sheet as well as Creator and Title on the CF Document sheet. The smart level field works like this:

The spreadsheet view of correctly  entering a statement with smartlevel looks as follows:

.. image:: static/smartlevelspreadsheet1.png

On a live framework in OpenSALT, you would see this represented as:

.. image:: static/smartlevel.png

Once you have populated these two fields, upon import OpenSALT will create identifiers and relevant IsChildOf associations automatically.

If the framework you are importing already exists on the server, it will update that framework and let you know with a message.

6.2.4 Delete Frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Audience: Super Users, Organization Admins**

OpenSALT allows Super Users and Organization Admins to delete Frameworks if needed. Note once a Framework is deleted the action can not be undone. The framework and all associations will be permanently removed from the database.

To delete a framework the Super User or Organization Admin will first need to log into OpenSALT.

Next view the selected Framework by expanding the organization and clicking on the selected Framework.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_64.png

6.2.5 Update Frameworks from a spreadsheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenSALT allows organization admins and above to download a framework as an excel document and make the following changes that can be merged back into the framework on the server:
- Update an item's text based on the same guid (will overwrite any other field in that line)
- Add an item to the the spreadsheet - do not enter an identifier; one will be created for you on update
- Delete an item when removing the identifier

- If a parent statement is deleted, those children statements will be ungrouped as "orphans"

Note that the framework should only be updated from within the Document itself using the Update button. Furthermore, note that currently these changes are irreversible within the application. The Update code searches for the Cf Item identifier and then performs the update procedures described above based on that business logic. (Eg if it finds a new identifier, it adds the CF Item. If it does not find an identifier previously present, that item is removed from the server).

6.2.6 Create new associations via Spreadsheet Update Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenSALT is able to use this function as well to update/create associations with generally the same user actions. Note that you have to be using the 'latest' spreadsheet download each time you update a framework.

.. _h405471134e472ab58320531a7c444:

6.2.6.1 Update Associations for frameworks on the same server

Simply enter the guids and association type you want in the appropriate columns on the Cf Association Tab of the downloaded spreadsheet. Do not enter an identiifer for the association action itself; this will be created by OpenSALT on upload.

.. image:: static/associations_update.png

.. _h405471134e472ab58320531a7c455:

6.2.6.2 Update Associations from an external server

This process is the same as for frameworks on the same server with two steps prior to the download, change, and update.

Steps:
1) Load an external framework within the framework you are working in.
2) Make one association from that document to the framework you are working on now.
3) Now use the guids from the external framework in the spreadsheet update tool as detailed above and the associations will load with connections to that external framework.

6.2.7  Copy Framework Only

When viewing a framework in the tree view, with sufficient rights on the CF Document item detail pane you will see a button to Copy Framework. This will open up an additional dialog box for multiple options to copy the entire framework documents

6.2.7.1 Copy Content Only

If you are intending on creating a new framework from the existing one, or simply with to add the current items to an existing framework, use this option. It will copy the framework items and structure and create new GUIDS for the items in the new framework. Associations are not transferred or created.

.. image:: static/copy_content.png

.. _h405471134e472ab58320531a7c458:

6.2.7.2 Copy and Make Derivative Framework

This will copy the framework items into a the target document and create Exact Match Of associations between origin and target items. No other associations will be copied. **There is a bug in OpenSALT 2.2 where a hard refresh is necessary before the copied CFItems are viewable to the user undertaking the copy action.**

6.3 Framework Items
-------------------

Items can be created for Frameworks either by importing existing data using the OpenSALT CSV template or by manually creating the items.

6.3.1 Import Items with OpenSALT Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can create their own CASE-compliant data files to load into OpenSALT using a provided CSV template and guide. This allows users to easily import their items or standards into their created framework and eliminates the need for manually entering the data into the system. The template can be found here:  \ |LINK12|\ .

6.3.1.1 CSV Loading Guide for CASE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Note that since OpenSALT 2.0 it is preferred to use the Spreadsheet Importer instead of this CSV Import.

General notes when loading/creating CSV files for bulk upload of child statements:

The only required field to upload a framework is FullStatement, but to build a hierarchy you will need Human Coding Scheme as well as the two layers for IsChildOf.

If an identifier exists, it will be transferred to the OpenSALT system. If it does not exist one will be created upon upload and creation.

SequenceNumber may be used to denote a particular order within parent nodes.

Currently the only fields with Rich Text capability through markdown are FullStatement and Notes.

See "CASE.csv" in the /opensalt/sample files/.

Tab 1: Step 1 Read This

An Overview of the process for creating the CSV to import the data.

Step 1: Create New Framework

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_69.png
   :height: 49 px
   :width: 120 px


Step 2: Select “Import Children”

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_70.png

   :width: 422 px


Step 3: Select your CSV

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_71.png
   :height: 152 px
   :width: 538 px


Step 4: If your CSV has associations to external frameworks in the full human readable terms (ie  CCSS.MATH.Content.K.CC.A.1) select the framework you want to associate it too. If nothing just leave alone

Step 5: Select Import Children

Tab 2: CF DOC

The only required fields are Creator and title. Creator is the folder that will be created.


Tab 3: CF ITEM

Explanation of the item fields that will be included in template for the Framework. Note that technically only fullStatement and humanCodingScheme are required.

The only required field is fullstatement.

To create a hierarchy however, use human coding scheme, ischildOf and SequenceNumber

example:

+---------------+------------------+-----------+----------------+
|fullStatement  |humanCodingScheme |IsChildOf  |SequenceNumber  |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+----------------+
|Parent Item    | P                |           | 1              |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+----------------+
|Child 1        | P.C              | P         | 1              |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+----------------+
| Grandchild 1  | P.C.G            | P.C       | 1              |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+----------------+
| Child 2       | P.C2             | P         | 2              |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+----------------+
| Grandchild 2  |P.C2.G            | P.C2      | 1              |
+---------------+------------------+-----------+----------------+


Tab 4: CF Association

The process for associations which can be associated in the template if desired, though associations may be easier managed in the UI itself after the Framework is created and imported.

Tab 6: Template

The template itself that will be used to add the data into the correct format and  saved as a CSV to import into OpenSALT.

You may use these fields as your template and save into a CSV.

6.3.1.2 Import Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After reviewing the **CSV Loading Guide for CASE** and the user will need to format their data into the Template Tab then save the file locally to their computer as a CSV file. This will save only the Template Tab and convert the data from an Excel file to a CSV file for import.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_77.png
   :height: 192 px
   :width: 624 px


Next the user will need to Import the items/children for the Frameworks. Click on the **Import Children** button in the **Item Details Frame** on the right of the selected framework to open the **Import Items** window.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_78.png
   :height: 344 px
   :width: 566 px


Select the tab for where your template file is located. If the CSV is stored locally on your computer,  click on the Import local File tab. Browse and select your file with the Choose File button. If a specific Framework to be associated is preferred, mark that selection otherwise the default is All. Then click the Import Children button to import the items for the framework.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_79.png
   :height: 220 px

Item full statements can be formatted using three different methods / pure UTF8 text can be enhanced with:

* Markdown

* Katex

* Limited HTML tags

These three formatting options for text can be combined in-line with limitations. Also note that HTML and Katex will not render consistently in the Tree and top of the Item Detail pane.

6.3.2.1 Using HTML Tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of OpenSALT build 1.3. Some HTML tags are allowed despite HTML sanitization. The tags that will render are:

ul, ol, li, b, i, u, br, p

6.3.2.2 Using Markdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that since OpenSALT uses markdown(\ |LINK13|\ ) as the primary formatting language, there could be unintended formatting consequences when importing from external sources.

6.3.2.3 Using Katex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Katex system supports plain text writing of all KaTeX functions listed \ |LINK14|\ . In-line Katex is formatted as braced between dollar signs ($):

6.3.3 Create Items Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Audience: Super Users, Super Editor, Organization Admins, Organization Editor**

When a Framework is created it is item neutral and is open for organizational content to be added based on the user’s needs. In addition to the Item import in section \ |LINK15|\ , OpenSALT allows users to manually create items and organize the data through the OpenSALT UI.

.. |LINK15| raw:: html

    <a href="#heading=h.6jki613css7u">6.5.1</a>

On the **Framework Display** page, click on the Item or Framework name that will act as a parent for the item to be added. Then in the **Item Details Frame** click on the **Add New Child Item** button.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_107.png
   :height: 185 px
   :width: 624 px


The **Add New Child Item** window will display.

Enter in the appropriate values for all available fields. At a minimum enter in  mandatory **Full Statement.**

* *FullStatement*: The the main content of the CF Item. It is used to express both nodes and granular statements. If the statement is part of a list, the list enumeration should not be included in the statement and should instead be contained in the List Enumeration in Source Document. This is a mandatory field in OpenSALT.

* *HumanCodingScheme*: The ID sometimes used by humans to identify a CF Item. It often will use concatenated codes expressing its position in the taxonomy and abbreviations to convey other classification information (e.g. K.CC.1.1). This is an optional field in OpenSALT.

* *ListEnumeration*: Used to parse out enumerations or bullets that precede CF Item statements. This is an optional field in OpenSALT..

* *AbbreviatedStatement:* Abbreviated or summary statement provided by the Publisher. This is an optional field in OpenSALT and may be blank.

* *ConceptKeywords:* Upper level CF Item node statements may be used to populate Concept Keywords of lower level nodes. upper The concepts data structure allows a master list of keywords to be defined which can then be parsed down specific to a node. This works as usually concepts will be a less granular hierarchy representation of of the more detailed nodes in CF items. A node could be 'Geometry' and the lower node is 'Tangents' but the keywords for 'tangents' could include the word geometry. This is an optional field in OpenSALT and may be blank.

* *Language:* HTML Language Country Code VIA- country code from \ |LINK16|\ . This is an optional field in OpenSALT. If best practices are not followed, this field may be blank. However OpenSALT assumes English if not other language value is entered.

.. |LINK16| raw:: html

    <a href="https://tooCF.ietf.org/html/bcp47" target="_blank">https://tooCF.ietf.org/html/bcp47</a>

* *EducationLevel:* 	The current US K12 defined vocabulary is to use CEDS https://ceds.ed.gov/cedselementdetaiCF.aspx?termid=8267. Multiple values are allowed via comma delimitation and should be used to express grade spans. This is an optional field in OpenSALT and may be blank.

* *ItemType:* e.g., "Standard," "Benchmark," "Strand," or "Topic." or "Level 1, Level 2,..." This is an optional field in OpenSALT and may be blank.

* *License uri:*  Systems may filter for content with particular licences to support discovery. This is an optional field in OpenSALT and may be blank.

* *Notes:* In some cases, this can be used to contain additional information found in the original source document. This is an optional field in OpenSALT and may be blank.

6.3.4 Parent vs Child Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the Item is created it will by default only be a child of the item it was created for.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_109.png
   :height: 241 px
   :width: 590 px


To add items nested below the item created, the user will need to make this item a Parent item. Highlight the item on in the **Framework Display** and click on the **Make This Item a Parent** button in the **Item Detail Frame**.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_110.png
   :height: 252 px
   :width: 617 px


The bullet icon on the left of the item in the **Framework Display** will update to reflect it is now a P**arent item**  and the buttons in the **Item Detail Frame** will update to allow the user to either downgrade back to a child with the **Make This Item a Child** button or to add a new child for this parent item with the **Add a New Child** *button.*

The user can toggle the item between **Parent or Child** as necessary by clicking the **Make This Item a Parent** or **Make this Item a Child** buttons respectively.

Note an item can be a Child of an item and a Parent to other items, however an item can not be a Child of an item with children below it. This item must be upgraded to a Parent to have children.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_111.png
   :height: 254 px
   :width: 624 px


The user can repeat this process an unlimited number of times to continue adding all items and marking them as Parents when appropriate to complete the full content for the framework.

6.3.5.1 Edit Item Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To **edit** an item, the user must click on the item in the **Framework Display** and then click on the **Edit** button in the **Item Detail Frame.**

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_116.png
   :height: 264 px
   :width: 581 px

6.3.5.2 Edit Item Positions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Audience: Super Users, Super Editor, Organization Admins, Organization Editor**

OpenSALT enables users to move items within frameworks and reorder without the need to edit each item. The user must first enable the functionality but checkin on the box at the top of the Framework Display to Enable drag-drop reordering.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_118.png
   :height: 196 px
   :width: 456 px


With the box checked and the function enabled, the user can now click on an item and drag and drop it to another location. Note clicking on a child will only move the child, whereas selecting a Parent will move the parent and all of it’s children.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_119.png
   :height: 233 px
   :width: 302 px
.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_120.png
   :height: 233 px
   :width: 304 px


Note with the drag and drop feature, items can be indented (moved to new parents) outdented to become parents, and all data can be fully moved around. However once an item is moved, there is no undo button, so the user would need to manually move (drag/drop) the item to the original position if the move is not required or done in error. Because of this, the feature is always defaulted to unchecked so no errors are accidentally made.

6.5 Derivative Frameworks - Copy Items
--------------------------------------

**Audience: Super Users, Super Editor, Organization Admins, Organization Editor**

OpenSALT allows users to create derivative frameworks  from frameworks within an OpenSALT server or instance.  Creating a derivative framework allows organizations to take a base original copy of a framework and expand it to better meet its needs.  The illustration below shows how the derivative frameworks fit with the scope of frameworks as a whole. Derivative frameworks essentially act as a bridge for organizations to navigate education needs.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_130.jpeg
   :height: 348 px
   :width: 553 px


The user will need to be logged into OpenSALT and create or select the framework that will act as the new derivative framework or copy. Please see section \ |LINK17|\  if assistance is needed on how to create a framework. On the **Framework Display** page, click on the **Copy Items** button in the **Item Detail** frame.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_144.png
   :height: 342 px
   :width: 624 px


Click on the required Framework to display the framework and items.

Alternatively you can select The final option: **Load an “external” document by url…** This allows the user to select any CASE compliant framework that is stored on an external location.

The **Load External Document** window will display. The user will need to copy and paste, or type in the url for the Case-compliant framework.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_145.png
   :height: 186 px

6.7 Export Frameworks Packages
-------------------------------

**Audience: Super Users, Super Editor, Organization Admins, Organization Editor, Public**

OpenSALT is designed to enable all users roles to **Export** complete framework packages or documents. While **Public** users can only export framework packages that are in an **Adopted**, **Draft**, or **Depreciated** release status, credentialed users will have the ability to export **Draft** and **Private Draft** framework packages as well.

To **Export** a framework package the user needs to be on the **Framework Display** page for the selected framework and then click on the **Export** button.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_171.png
   :height: 194 px
   :width: 624 px


An Export window will display to provide the user with several **Export** options:

* Competency Framework Package (JSON)

* Spreadsheet Export


.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_172.png
   :height: 229 px
   :width: 573 px


The user can select an **Export** option or can click on the **Done** button or the ‘**X**’ at the top of the window  to close the **Export** window. Each **Export** type will be discussed in the following subsections.

.. _h163e401e8291001a4c5447e45136c:

6.7.1 Export Competency Framework Package (JSON) File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first **Export** option is the **Competency Framework Package (JSON)**. This option allows users to extract the data for the framework packaging in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format. This is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format that allows for easy ingestion into other system and applications using a common standard programming language.

When a user mouses over the **Competency Framework Package (JSON)** button, a soft explanation is displayed that advises the user of the button’s intended purpose: ‘Exports a JSON file using the IMS-standard format. This is the best format to user for Archiving Frameworks.’

   :width: 624 px


.. _h596b20112477664e57757b30727b58:

6.7.2 Export Spreadsheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second **Export** option is the **Spreadsheet Export.** This option allows users to extract the data for the framework packaging in a spreadsheet file that can be opened/viewed/edited in a program like Microsoft’s Excel or Google Sheets.

When a user mouses over the **Spreadsheet Export** button, a soft explanation is displayed that advises the user of the button’s intended purpose: ‘Exports as an Excel spreadsheet file that you can open and edit in spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel. ’

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_177.png
   :height: 249 px
   :width: 624 px


To generate a spreadsheet file for the Framework Package, the user will click on the **Spreadsheet Export** *button.* The browser will automatically create and download a case xlsx file for the Framework Package. The user will need to retrieve the file following the browser’s specific protocol and path. The image below shows the download in Chrome. Note the file is in the download frame at the bottom of the page. It has also been added to the user’s Download folder within the user’s My Documents.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_178.png
   :height: 269 px
   :width: 624 px


To open the spreadsheet file the user will need to identify a compatible application on their computer. The most common applications used are Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

Users credentialed users who are experienced with importing Frameworks into OpenSALT with the CASE template will already be familiar with this spreadsheet format. For all other users, the following details the exported spreadsheet file.

When opened the spreadsheet file will have three tabs:

#. CF Doc

#. CF Item

#. CF Association

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_179.png

   :width: 292 px


.. _h2c3d432f26522266f31614d703c15b:

6.7.2.1 CF Doc Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of the first tab, CF Doc, is to provide the user with basic background information on the Framework Package.

.. image:: static/OpenSALT_User_Manual_180.png
   :height: 61 px
   :width: 829 px


The columns on the spreadsheet include the following:

* *Identifier:*  The identifier is intended to be used as the primary key global identifier within or external to the system. This is a mandatory field in OpenSALT and the export will contain data.

* *Creator:*  The entity that authorized or created the competency framework. It could be an education agency, higher education institution, professional body. It is the owner of the competency framework (e.g CCSSO, TEA, NGSS). This is a mandatory field in OpenSALT and the export will contain data.

* *Title*: The title as it appears on the cover of the Official Source artifact, although it may be a title created by the Publisher. This is a mandatory field in OpenSALT and the export will contain data.

* *LastChangeDateTime:* The field is used to establish any change, not just major version revisions. This is a mandatory field in OpenSALT and the export will contain data.

* *OfficialsourceURL*:  The URL of the artifact adopted by the Standard Setting Entity. Often this document is published in html and/or as pdf and is used by the standard setting entity as part of its approval process. Since it is not the intent of this specification to fully reproduce the human-facing content and formatting of the source document, it is recommended that this document be transmitted as part of the competency framework package. This is an optional field in OpenSALT. If best practices are not followed, this field may be blank.

* *Publisher:*  The entity that loads and publishes the Framework. Note that in  many cases, the Standard Setting Entity may lack technical capabilities to publish the Competency Framework in a standard format so a third party may be displayed. This is an optional field in OpenSALT. If best practices are not followed, this field may be blank.

* *Description:*  The description is typically created by the the Publisher as a standard description of the Competency Framework.This is an optional field in OpenSALT. If best practices are not followed, this field may be blank.

* *Subject:* This is a string expressing the general subject area of the Competency Framework (e.g. Mathematics). This is an optional field in OpenSALT. If best practices are not followed, this field may be blank.

* *Language:* HTML Language Country Code VIA- country code from \ |LINK26|\ . This is an optional field in OpenSALT. If best practices are not followed, this field may be blank. However OpenSALT assumes English if not other language value is entered.

.. |LINK26| raw:: html

    <a href="https://tooCF.ietf.org/html/bcp47" target="_blank">https://tooCF.ietf.org/html/bcp47</a>

* *Version:* This is used to separate any version information expressed by the Official Source artifact. Once and CF Pkg has been approved and published, any changes to an CF Item will constitute a new version of the CF Doc. This is an optional field in OpenSALT. If best practices are not followed, this field may be blank.

* *Identifier:*  The identifier is intended to be used as the primary key global identifier within or external to the system. This is a mandatory field in OpenSALT and the export will contain data.

* *FullStatement*: The the main content of the CF Item. It is used to express both nodes and granular statements. If the statement is part of a list, the list enumeration should not be included in the statement and should instead be contained in the List Enumeration in Source Document. This is a mandatory field in OpenSALT and the export will contain data.

* *HumanCodingScheme*: The ID sometimes used by humans to identify a CF Item.

* *ConceptKeywords:* Upper level CF Item node statements may be used to populate Concept Keywords of lower level nodes. upper The concepts data structure allows a master list of keywords to be defined which can then be parsed down specific to a node. This works as usually concepts will be a less granular hierarchy representation of of the more detailed nodes in CF items. A node could be 'Geometry' and the lower node is 'Tangents' but the keywords for 'tangents' could include the word geometry. This is an optional field in OpenSALT and may be blank.

7.3 Additional Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenSALT 2.2 has the ability to add additional fields to the CfItem entity. These fields will NOT be exported with a standard CASE export or visible via the API. They will however be viewable when editing the Cf Item of any framework on that OpenSALT instance and be exported/able to be updated via the Spreadsheet Updater.

To view the additional fields, login and a super user and go to <server name>/additional_field eg frameworks.act.org/additional_field

7.4 File Storage and Image Attachment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Often users want to attach an image to the notes section for clarity, or perhaps fullStatement can point to a learning object etc. The ability to add uploads and images was created for this type of functionality.

*7.4.1 Configuration*

While files cannot be stored natively in the CASE JSON, OpenSALT allows administrators setting up OpenSALT to include an AWS bucket as well as a prefix in the docker-compose.yml file - then the images are inserted with the native markdown/attachments are linked. Make sure your bucket is public if you intend for the CASE framework to be shared and disseminated publicly.

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
AWS_S3_BUCKET:
AWS_S3_REGION:
AWS_S3_PREFIX:
ATTACHMENT_URL_PREFIX:
BUCKET_PROVIDER:

*7.4.2 Usage*

Users may drag and drop and image into the fullStatement and Notes field when this functionality is enabled. Future plans would add it to Exemplar as well but that is not on the OpenSALT roadmap at this time.

7.5 Clone Framework
New in OpenSALT 2.3 is the ability to clone a framework directly. This is used in best practice when template frameworks are needed. The clone button shows up for editors with proper permissions

.. image:: static/clonebutton.png

7.6 Mirroring Frameworks
New in OpenSALT is the ability to mirror public frameworks in external servers to OpenSALT using the Case API. Credentialed users can add, delete, and edit mirrored frameworks within the "Manage Mirrors" function. 

.. image:: static/mirror1.png

Credentialed users will see the list of mirrored servers, the frameworks mirrored within them, and their status. Options to add a new framework, as well as edit or delete an existing framework are also displayed.
